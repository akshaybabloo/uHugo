Cloudflare
==========

.. versionadded:: 0.0.3

`Cloudflare Pages <https://pages.cloudflare.com/>`_ can be used to host static files that's generated by Hugo. Unlike Netlify and Vercel, Cloudflare pages does not
come with a configuration file. That means to set the Hugo version an API is used to update or add ``HUGO_VERSION`` environment variable. uHugo can help you with that.

To tell uHugo to use Cloudflare the following configuration needs to be done in either ``config.yaml`` or ``config.toml``.

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: toml config.toml

        [uhugo]
        name = "cloudflare"
        project = "some-name"
        email_address = "env:email_address"
        account_id = "env:account_id"
        api_key = "env:api_key"

    .. code-tab:: yaml config.yaml

        uhugo:
            name: "cloudflare"
            project: "some-name"
            email_address: "env:email_address"
            account_id: "env:account_id"
            api_key: "env:api_key"

``email_address`` is your authentication email ID, ``account_id`` can be retrieved from `Workers Dashboard <https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers>`_ and 
``api_key`` can be retrieved from `API Token <https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens>`_ and copy the "Global API Key". 

.. note:: ``api_key`` must be a "Global API Key" or else the API cannot be authenticated.

.. warning:: For security reasons, it is highly recommended that you not save API keys in the configuration file but rather set it as an environment variable.
    For example, whenever a configuration property is set to ``env:api_key``, uHugo will search for ``api_key=some-key`` as the environment variable.
